# Quick Fix Summary: "Failed to fetch" Error

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

The "Failed to fetch" error you encountered was caused by **missing Supabase configuration**. Your app was trying to connect to placeholder URLs instead of your actual Supabase project.

### Changes Made:

1. **Created `.env.local` file** with proper structure and instructions
2. **Improved error handling** in `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` to detect configuration issues
3. **Added configuration checks** before making API calls to provide clearer error messages

## üö® What You Need to Do Next

**Your app will still show errors until you complete these steps:**

### Step 1: Get Your Supabase Credentials

1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Sign in and create a new project (or open existing one)
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **API**
4. Copy these two values:
   - **Project URL** (looks like: `https://abcdefg.supabase.co`)
   - **anon public key** (starts with `eyJ...`)

### Step 2: Update Your Environment File

1. Open `.env.local` in your project root
2. Replace the placeholder values:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-actual-project-id.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...your-actual-key
   ```

### Step 3: Restart Your Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Set Up Your Database

Follow the instructions in `DATABASE_SETUP.md` to create the required database tables.

## üîç Error Prevention

The improved error handling will now show clearer messages like:
- "Supabase is not configured. Please set up your environment variables in .env.local file."
- Instead of the generic "Failed to fetch" error

## üìÅ Files Modified

- ‚úÖ `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Added configuration checks and better error messages
- ‚úÖ `.env.local` - Created with proper structure (you need to add real values)

## üîí Security

- The `.env.local` file is already in `.gitignore` - your credentials won't be committed
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are safe for browser exposure (they're public keys)

**Next Step**: Replace the placeholder values in `.env.local` with your actual Supabase credentials!
